# Enhancing ROP Image Analysis through Synthetic Data and Attention Mechanisms

This repository contains the code developed during my internship project titled **"Enhancing ROP Image Analysis through Synthetic Data and Attention Mechanisms"**. The project was completed under the guidance of [Dr. Raul Benitez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-benitez-iglesias-1a1520218/)

This repository contains code for:
1. **Model Training:** Code for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) using the synthetic data.
2. **Attention Maps Generation:** Code for extracting attention maps from the trained models.
3. **Interpretability Analysis:** Code for performing interpretability analysis on the generated attention maps.

The code for generating the synthetic data used in this project can be found in the [synthetic-tortuousity-dataset](https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/synthetic-tortuosity-dataset) repository.
